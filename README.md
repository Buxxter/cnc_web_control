# cnc_web_control
Control interface for ESP-Link connected to your CNC

This "project" depends on https://github.com/jeelabs/esp-link to add WiFi to your CNC Router built on Woodpacker-like motherboards.

What to do:
1. Flash your ESP8266 board with esp-link
2. Connect to your CNC and make sure it works as expected
3. Go to the web interface of your esp-link board
4. Click "Web Server" in the Menu of your module and upload the index.html
5. The previous steps will add a new item called 'index' in your Menu. Click it 

v.0.01:
- initial commit :-)
